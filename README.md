# Responsible Science

There are two related concepts:

1. RCR: Responsible Conduct of Research (see, eg, the [NSF resources](https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/rcr.jsp)).
2. RRI: Responsible Research and Innovation (see, eg, the [European Commision's pages](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/responsible-research-innovation)

This repository gathers material for a talk/workshop on these issues. Aims to be heavily example driven. Audiences to include NGCM (computing PGs) and GR/Astro PGs.
